## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project was designed to parse Nginx logs and then take action based upon the information it gathers. Keywords are selected, and then if they are found within request URI in the nginx logs the offending IP is banned at the kernel level using iptables. This program assumes that iptables is installed and you are running a bash shell.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install Nginx

https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html

```
sudo apt-get install nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

Make sure iptables is installed

```
which iptables
```
if you dont see something like '/usr/sbin/iptables' then you may install it

```
sudo apt-get install iptables
```
### Installing

Create a directory to clone the repository into

```
mkdir projects
```

Clone the repository from github
```
git clone git@github.com:nobelsmith/go-fence.git
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Change Nginx Log Format for Parsing.

Add the following lines to your nginx.conf (likely found at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf)

```
	log_format logger-json-log escape=json '{'
	'"body_bytes_sent":"$body_bytes_sent",'
	'"bytes_sent":"$bytes_sent",'
	'"http_host":"$http_host",'
	'"http_referer":"$http_referer",'
	'"http_user_agent":"$http_user_agent",'
	'"msec":"$msec",'
	'"remote_addr":"$remote_addr",'
	'"request_method":"$request_method",'
	'"request_uri":"$request_uri",'
	'"server_port":"$server_port",'
	'"server_protocol":"$server_protocol",'
	'"ssl_protocol":"$ssl_protocol",'
	'"status":"$status",'
	'"upstream_response_time":"$upstream_response_time",'
	'"upstream_addr":"$upstream_addr",'
	'"upstream_connect_time":"$upstream_connect_time"'
	'}';

	access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log logger-json-log;
```
An example nginx.conf file can be found in the examples folder of the project.

### Setup Protected IPs, Honey Pots, and Log File within main.go
```
var protectedIPs = []string{"192.168.*", "172.16.*", "10.*", "127*"}
var honeyPot = []string{"wp-admin", "wp-includes", ".aspx"}
var logFile = "/var/log/nginx/access.log"
```

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

### Build the project
```
go build -o go-fence
```

### Setup Project on Host Machine

One way to use this executable would be to put it into an executable directory such as bin and then schedule a cronjob to use it. For example:
```
# crontab -e
* * * * * /usr/local/bin/go-fence >> /var/log/go-fence.log
```
